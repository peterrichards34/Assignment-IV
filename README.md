Assessing Induced Polarization (IP) Signatures of Microbial-Mineral Interactions in Permafrost Environments Using Synthetic Data
## The following is a forward simulation using synthetic data to analyze microbe-mineral interactions motivated by the recent and continued release of microbes from the permafrost as the permafrost melts at increasing rates. ##
